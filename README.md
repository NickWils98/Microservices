# Microservices
To run this project docker deamon should be installed.
Unpack the project en run "run.sh" from inside the folder.

The website will be visible on "localhost:8081".

Your default browser will start after 10 seconds, it is possible you need to refresh this if the countainers are still building.

I used the following ports for the host:

• 5433 : postgres

• 8001 : Login

• 8002 : Friend

• 8003 : Group

• 8004 : Search
